# jcmpython

This module helps to run, analyze and save the results of simulations using
the python interface of the excellent commercial finite element Maxwell solver
[JCMsuite](http://www.jcmwave.com/), developed by JCMwave.

## Usage

Detailed information will appear here soon. So far, start by going through the
example notebooks *Setting up a configuration file* and 
*Using jcmpython - the mie2D-project* (in this order). A minimal example to get
started is given in the *Getting started - for the impatient* notebook.

**Any feedback is highly appreciated.**
