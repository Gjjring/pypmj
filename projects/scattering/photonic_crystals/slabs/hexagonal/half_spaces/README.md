# Description

Unit cell of a photonic crystal (PhC) slab with hexagonal lattice of conically 
shaped of holes (if the side-wall angle is different from 0Â°). The slab is
surrounded by half-spaces of uniform material, called *subspace* below the PhC
and *superspace* above the PhC and inside the holes.
