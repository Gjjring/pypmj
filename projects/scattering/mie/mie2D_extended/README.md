# Description

The **mie2D_extended-project** is the extended version of the mie2D-project, 
containing a larger number of parameters, e.g. for convergence testing.
It describes the light scattering off an infinite glass rod. The surroundings 
consist of air. The incoming light field has a vacuum wavelength of
$\lambda_0=550\,\mathrm{nm}$ and is polarized in $z$-direction with amplitude 
equal to one. The radius of the glass rod is parameterized. It has a fixed
refractive index of $n=1.52$. *Please see the [online tutorial][JCMtutorial] for
more information*.

## Simulation setup

Fig. 1 shows a sketch of the simulation setup and defines the orientation axes
and illumination conditions.

## Mesh and field examples

Fig. 2 shows a generated mesh for a radius of $0.6$, i.e. $600\,\mathrm{nm}$ in
the unit of length that is specified in `layout.jcmt`. It also shows the
computed electric field strength for this mesh.

# Parameters

## Project specific

Key | Default | Description
:---|:-------:| -----------
`fem_degree_max` | | The maximum FEM degree used in the adaptive approach
`precision_field_energy` | | `Precision` parameter in Scattering->Accuracy section, controlling the numerical accuracy of the near field.

## Geometry specific

Key | Default | Description
:---|:-------:| -----------
`radius` | | The radius of the glass sphere in Âµm
`slc_domain` | | Maximum side length of air surrounding the glass rod
`slc_circle` | | Maximum side length of the glass rod
`refine_all_circle` | | Number of subsequent segmentations of the glass rod

# Tested processing functions

This section lists tested processing functions which can be used for the 
`processing_func`-argument, e.g. for the `run`-method of
`pypmj.SimulationSet`.

---

This function reads out the real part of the electromagnetic energy flux
computed by the `FluxIntegration` post process and stores it with key `'SCS'`
in the results dictionary.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ python
def read_scs(pp):
    results = {} #must be a dict
    results['SCS'] = pp[0]['ElectromagneticFieldEnergyFlux'][0][0].real
    return results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Notes

Please see the *Using pypmj - the mie2D-project* notebook in the `examples`
directory shipped with pypmj. It provides a detailed explanation on how to
run the mie2D project, which is the less parameterized version of this project.
A tutorial on running convergence tests can be found in the *Running
convergence tests* notebook, which uses this project.
